      <h1> Information</h1>
      Cancer is one of the twelve constellations of the zodiac and is located in the Northern celestial hemisphere. Its old astronomical symbol is Cancer symbol (fixed width).svg (♋︎). Its name is Latin for crab and it is commonly represented as one. Cancer is a medium-size constellation with an area of 506 square degrees and its stars are rather faint, its brightest star Beta Cancri having an apparent magnitude of 3.5. It contains two stars with known planets, including 55 Cancri, which has five: one super-earth and four gas giants, one of which is in the habitable zone and as such has expected temperatures similar to Earth. At the (angular) heart of this sector of our celestial sphere is Praesepe (Messier 44), one of the closest open clusters to Earth and a popular target for amateur astronomers

         <h2> How it formed </h2>
         The constellation Cancer was given its name by the ancient Greeks, and it is often depicted as a crab. The origins of the Cancer constellation myth are unclear, but it is believed to be associated with the story of Heracles (Hercules) and the Hydra.
According to the myth, the Hydra was a giant serpent with many heads. Heracles was sent to kill the serpent as part of his twelve labors. While he was engaged in battle with the Hydra, the goddess Hera, who hated Heracles, sent a crab to pinch his toes and distract him. Heracles noticed the crab and crushed it, but Hera was pleased with the crab’s efforts, and so she placed its image in the sky as a reward.
Thus, the Cancer constellation was born from the legend of a tiny creature that tried to help the Hydra defeat Heracles. <br>

    <h4> Fun fact !</h4>
    The Cancer constellation is one of the twelve constellations of the zodiac and is located between Gemini and Leo. Its name comes from the Latin word for crab, as the stars in this constellation were thought to resemble a crab's shape to ancient Greek and Roman astronomers. Cancer is also home to one of the most famous star clusters, the Beehive Cluster, which is visible to the naked eye on a clear night. Additionally, Cancer is associated with astrological traits such as sensitivity, emotion, and intuition. <br>
